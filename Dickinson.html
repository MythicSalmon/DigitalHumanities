    <p><strong>"A Loaded Gun"</strong></p>
    
    <p>My Life had stood - a Loaded Gun - <br>
In Corners - till a Day <br>
The Owner passed - identified - <br> 
And carried Me away - <br> 
<br>
And now We roam in Sovreign Woods - <br>
And now We hunt the Doe - <br>
And every time I speak for Him <br>
The Mountains straight reply - <br>
<br>
And do I smile, such cordial light <br>
Opon the Valley glow - <br>
It is as a Vesuvian face <br>
Had let it’s pleasure through - <br>
<br>
And when at Night - Our good Day done - <br>
I guard My Master’s Head - <br>
’Tis better than the Eider Duck’s <br>
Deep Pillow - to have shared - <br>
<br>
To foe of His - I’m deadly foe - <br>
None stir the second time - <br>
On whom I lay a Yellow Eye - <br>
Or an emphatic Thumb - <br>
<br>
Though I than He - may longer live <br>
He longer must - than I - <br>
For I have but the power to kill, <br>
Without - the power to die -</p>
